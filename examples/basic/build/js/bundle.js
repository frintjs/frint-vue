     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }
     * };
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.
     * .subscribe(sumObserver);
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"

 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.
 * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.
 * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,
 * but with provided scheduler.

 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.
 * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.
 * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,

     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,

 * Observables to the output Observable. The output Observable only completes
 * once all input Observables have completed. Any error delivered by an input
 * Observable will be immediately emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * @example <caption>Merge together two Observables: 1s interval and clicks</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * var clicksOrTimer = Rx.Observable.merge(clicks, timer);

 *
 * // Results in the following:
 * // timer will emit ascending values, one every second(1000ms) to console
 * // clicks logs MouseEvents to console everytime the "document" is clicked
 * // Since the two streams are merged you see these happening
 * // as they occur.
 *
 * @example <caption>Merge together 3 Observables, but only 2 run concurrently</caption>
 * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);
 * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);
 * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);
 * var concurrent = 2; // the argument
 * var merged = Rx.Observable.merge(timer1, timer2, timer3, concurrent);
 * merged.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // Results in the following:
 * // - First timer1 and timer2 will run concurrently
 * // - timer1 will emit a value every 1000ms for 10 iterations
 * // - timer2 will emit a value every 2000ms for 6 iterations
 * // - after timer1 hits it's max iteration, timer2 will
 * //   continue, and timer3 will start to run concurrently with timer2
 * // - when timer2 hits it's max iteration it terminates, and
 * //   timer3 will continue to emit a value every 500ms until it is complete

 * When any of the provided Observable emits an complete or error notification, it immediately subscribes to the next one
 * that was passed.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Execute series of Observables no matter what, even if it means swallowing errors.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>
 * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)
 *   .map(x => {
 *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }
         return 10 / x;
 *   })
 *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))
 *   .subscribe(
 *     val => console.log(val),
 *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.
 *     () => console.log('that\'s it!')
 *   );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 10
 * // 5
 * // 3.3333333333333335
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // 3
 * // "that's it!"
 *
 * @see {@link concat}
 * @see {@link catch}
 *
 * @param {...ObservableInput} observables Observables passed either directly or as an array.
 * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits values from source Observable, but - if it errors - subscribes
 * to the next passed Observable and so on, until it completes or runs out of Observables.

 * Asap Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Perform task as fast as it can be performed asynchronously</span>
 *
 * `asap` scheduler behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler when you use it to delay task
 * in time. If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing
 * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code
 * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called "deferring".
 * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves
 * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.
 *
 * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process
 * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,
 * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but
 * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.
 *
 * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...
 * Rx.Scheduler.asap.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "asap"
 * // "async"
 * // ... but 'asap' goes first!

/**
 * When any of the provided Observable emits an complete or error notification, it immediately subscribes to the next one
 * that was passed.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Execute series of Observables no matter what, even if it means swallowing errors.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>
 * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)
 *   .map(x => {
 *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }
         return 10 / x;
 *   })
 *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))
 *   .subscribe(
 *     val => console.log(val),
 *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.
 *     () => console.log('that\'s it!')
 *   );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 10
 * // 5
 * // 3.3333333333333335
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // 3
 * // "that's it!"
 *
 * @see {@link concat}
 * @see {@link catch}
 *
 * @param {...ObservableInput} observables Observables passed either directly or as an array.
 * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits values from source Observable, but - if it errors - subscribes
 * to the next passed Observable and so on, until it completes or runs out of Observables.

 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately as well,
 * that task will be put on a queue and wait for current one to finish.
 *
 * This means that when you execute task with `queue` scheduler, you are sure it will end
 * before any other task scheduled with that scheduler will start.
 *
 * @examples <caption>Schedule recursively first, then do something</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => {
 *   Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => console.log('second')); // will not happen now, but will be put on a queue
 *
 *   console.log('first');
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 * // "second"
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Reschedule itself recursively</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(function(state) {
 *   if (state !== 0) {

 * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code
 * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called "deferring".
 * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves
 * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.
 *
 * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process
 * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,
 * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but
 * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.
 *
 * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>

    /**
     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
     * `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `conforms`, `constant`, `countBy`, `create`,
     * `curry`, `debounce`, `defaults`, `defaultsDeep`, `defer`, `delay`,
     * `difference`, `differenceBy`, `differenceWith`, `drop`, `dropRight`,

     * milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the debounced function was
     * invoked. The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel
     * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.
     * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the
     * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked
     * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent
     * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`
     * invocation.
     *
     * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
     * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function
     * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
     *
     * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred
     * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.
     *
     * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)
     * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.

     * Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and
     * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an
     * Observable.</span>
     *
     * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done.
     *
     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters
     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function
     * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function
     * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.
     * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting
     * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.
     *
     * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called
     * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output
     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request
     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.
     *
     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function
     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value
     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.
     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,
     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.
     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)
     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,
     * if there is only one.
     *
     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call
     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results
     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`
     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,
     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler
     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,
     * will end before `func` is invoked.
     *
     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted
     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,
     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.
     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.
     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`
     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.
     *
     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value
     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from
     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to
     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set
     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`
     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,
     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,
     * provided `func` is not already bound.
     *
     * If input function calls its callback in "node style" (i.e. first argument to callback is
     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.
     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter
     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.
     *

     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>
     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)
     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);
     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));

     * Converts a Node.js-style callback API to a function that returns an
     * Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">It's just like {@link bindCallback}, but the
     * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>
     *
     * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,
     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling
     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means
     * something went wrong.
     *
     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same
     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output
     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.
     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will
     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit
     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),
     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.
     *
     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to
     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular
     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but
     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.
     *
     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,
     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to
     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed
     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler
     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.
     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where
     * Scheduler works exactly the same.
     *
     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context
     * of returned function, when it is called.
     *
     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means
     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive
     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions
     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.
     * "Node.js-style" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for
     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,
     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.
     *
     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance
     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.
     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as "present", when value
     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty
     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error
     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when
     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you
     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,
     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.
     *
     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value
     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>
     * import * as fs from 'fs';
     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);
     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>
     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {
     *   console.log(err); // null
     *   console.log(a); // 5
     *   console.log(b); // "some string"
     * });
     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);
     * boundSomeFunction()
     * .subscribe(value => {
     *   console.log(value); // [5, "some string"]
     * });
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>
     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {
     *   console.log(err); // undefined
     *   console.log(a); // "abc"

/**
 * Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are
 * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits
 * the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s

     * Creates an Observable that, on subscribe, calls an Observable factory to

     *
     * `defer` allows you to create the Observable only when the Observer
     * subscribes, and create a fresh Observable for each Observer. It waits until
     * an Observer subscribes to it, and then it generates an Observable,
     * typically with an Observable factory function. It does this afresh for each
     * subscriber, so although each subscriber may think it is subscribing to the
     * same Observable, in fact each subscriber gets its own individual
     * Observable.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe to either an Observable of clicks or an Observable of interval, at random</caption>
     * var clicksOrInterval = Rx.Observable.defer(function () {
     *   if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
     *     return Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
     *   } else {
     *     return Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
     *   }
     * });
     * clicksOrInterval.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
     *
     * // Results in the following behavior:
     * // If the result of Math.random() is greater than 0.5 it will listen
     * // for clicks anywhere on the "document"; when document is clicked it
     * // will log a MouseEvent object to the console. If the result is less
     * // than 0.5 it will emit ascending numbers, one every second(1000ms).
     *
     * @see {@link create}
     *
     * @param {function(): SubscribableOrPromise} observableFactory The Observable
     * factory function to invoke for each Observer that subscribes to the output
     * Observable. May also return a Promise, which will be converted on the fly
     * to an Observable.
     * @return {Observable} An Observable whose Observers' subscriptions trigger
     * an invocation of the given Observable factory function.

 *
 * `sequenceEqual` subscribes to two observables and buffers incoming values from each observable. Whenever either
 * observable emits a value, the value is buffered and the buffers are shifted and compared from the bottom
 * up; If any value pair doesn't match, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one of the
 * observables completes, the operator will wait for the other observable to complete; If the other
 * observable emits before completing, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one observable never
 * completes or emits after the other complets, the returned observable will never complete.

 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.
 * );

 * Combines the source Observable with other Observables to create an Observable
 * whose values are calculated from the latest values of each, only when the
 * source emits.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Whenever the source Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using that value plus the latest values from other input
 * Observables, then emits the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/withLatestFrom.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `withLatestFrom` combines each value from the source Observable (the
 * instance) with the latest values from the other input Observables only when
 * the source emits a value, optionally using a `project` function to determine
 * the value to be emitted on the output Observable. All input Observables must
 * emit at least one value before the output Observable will emit a value.
 *
 * @example <caption>On every click event, emit an array with the latest timer event plus the click event</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * var result = clicks.withLatestFrom(timer);
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @see {@link combineLatest}
 *
 * @param {ObservableInput} other An input Observable to combine with the source
 * Observable. More than one input Observables may be given as argument.
 * @param {Function} [project] Projection function for combining values
 * together. Receives all values in order of the Observables passed, where the
 * first parameter is a value from the source Observable. (e.g.
 * `a.withLatestFrom(b, c, (a1, b1, c1) => a1 + b1 + c1)`). If this is not
 * passed, arrays will be emitted on the output Observable.
 * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent
 * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from
 * each input Observable.

 * It makes sure scheduled task will happen just before next browser content repaint,
 * thus performing animations as efficiently as possible.
 *
 * @example <caption>Schedule div height animation</caption>
 * const div = document.querySelector('.some-div');
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.schedule(function(height) {
 *   div.style.height = height + "px";
 *
 *   this.schedule(height + 1);  // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                               // which we reschedule with new state
 * }, 0, 0);

     * Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and
     * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an
     * Observable.</span>
     *
     * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done.
     *
     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters
     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function
     * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function
     * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.
     * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting
     * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.
     *
     * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called
     * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output
     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request
     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.
     *
     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function
     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value
     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.
     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,
     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.
     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)
     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,
     * if there is only one.
     *
     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call
     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results
     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`
     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,
     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler
     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,
     * will end before `func` is invoked.
     *
     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted
     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,
     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.
     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.
     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`
     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.
     *
     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value
     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from
     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to
     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set
     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`
     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,
     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,
     * provided `func` is not already bound.
     *
     * If input function calls its callback in "node style" (i.e. first argument to callback is
     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.
     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter
     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>
     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)
     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);
     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>
     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {
     *   console.log(a); // 5
     *   console.log(b); // 'some string'
     *   console.log(c); // {someProperty: 'someValue'}
     * });
     *
     * const boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(someFunction);
     * boundSomeFunction().subscribe(values => {
     *   console.log(values) // [5, 'some string', {someProperty: 'someValue'}]
     * });
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use bindCallback with selector function</caption>
     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {
     *   console.log(a); // 'a'
     *   console.log(b); // 'b'
     *   console.log(c); // 'c'
     * });
     *
     * const boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(someFunction, (a, b, c) => a + b + c);
     * boundSomeFunction().subscribe(value => {
     *   console.log(value) // 'abc'
     * });
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Compare behaviour with and without async Scheduler</caption>
     * function iCallMyCallbackSynchronously(cb) {
     *   cb();
     * }
     *
     * const boundSyncFn = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously);
     * const boundAsyncFn = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously, null, Rx.Scheduler.async);
     *
     * boundSyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was sync!'));
     * boundAsyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was async!'));
     * console.log('This happened...');
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // I was sync!
     * // This happened...
     * // I was async!
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use bindCallback on object method</caption>
     * const boundMethod = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(someObject.methodWithCallback);
     * boundMethod.call(someObject) // make sure methodWithCallback has access to someObject

     * Converts a Node.js-style callback API to a function that returns an
     * Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">It's just like {@link bindCallback}, but the
     * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>
     *
     * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,
     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling
     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means
     * something went wrong.
     *
     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same
     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output
     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.
     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will
     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit
     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),
     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.
     *
     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to
     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular
     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but
     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.
     *
     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,
     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to
     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed
     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler
     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.
     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where
     * Scheduler works exactly the same.
     *
     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context
     * of returned function, when it is called.
     *
     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means
     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive
     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions
     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.
     * "Node.js-style" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for
     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,
     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.
     *
     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance
     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.
     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as "present", when value
     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty
     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error
     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when
     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you
     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,
     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.
     *
     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value
     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>
     * import * as fs from 'fs';
     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);
     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>
     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {
     *   console.log(err); // null
     *   console.log(a); // 5
     *   console.log(b); // "some string"
     * });
     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);
     * boundSomeFunction()
     * .subscribe(value => {
     *   console.log(value); // [5, "some string"]
     * });
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>
     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {
     *   console.log(err); // undefined
     *   console.log(a); // "abc"
     *   console.log(b); // "DEF"
     * });
     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction, (a, b) => a + b);
     * boundSomeFunction()
     * .subscribe(value => {
     *   console.log(value); // "abcDEF"
     * });
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>
     * someFunction(a => {
     *   console.log(a); // 5
     * });
     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);
     * boundSomeFunction()
     * .subscribe(
     *   value => {}             // never gets called

 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s
 * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>
 * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);
 * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);
 * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));
 * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));
 *

 *
 * `debounceTime` delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops
 * previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source
 * Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the
 * source Observable, and emits that only when `dueTime` enough time has passed
 * without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value
 * appears before `dueTime` silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped
 * and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one
 * value to be emitted in any time window of duration `dueTime`, but it is also
 * a delay-like operator since output emissions do not occur at the same time as
 * they did on the source Observable. Optionally takes a {@link IScheduler} for
 * managing timers.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>

 * source value.
 * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=async] The {@link IScheduler} to use for

/**
 * Returns an Observable that emits all items emitted by the source Observable that are distinct by comparison from previous items.
 *
 * If a keySelector function is provided, then it will project each value from the source observable into a new value that it will
 * check for equality with previously projected values. If a keySelector function is not provided, it will use each value from the
 * source observable directly with an equality check against previous values.
 *
 * In JavaScript runtimes that support `Set`, this operator will use a `Set` to improve performance of the distinct value checking.
 *
 * In other runtimes, this operator will use a minimal implementation of `Set` that relies on an `Array` and `indexOf` under the
 * hood, so performance will degrade as more values are checked for distinction. Even in newer browsers, a long-running `distinct`
 * use might result in memory leaks. To help alleviate this in some scenarios, an optional `flushes` parameter is also provided so
 * that the internal `Set` can be "flushed", basically clearing it of values.
 *
 * @example <caption>A simple example with numbers</caption>
 * Observable.of(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1)
 *   .distinct()
 *   .subscribe(x => console.log(x)); // 1, 2, 3, 4
 *
 * @example <caption>An example using a keySelector function</caption>
 * interface Person {
 *    age: number,
 *    name: string

 *     { age: 4, name: 'Foo'},

 * Initially, the timer is disabled. As soon as the first source value arrives,
 * the timer is enabled by calling the `durationSelector` function with the
 * source value, which returns the "duration" Observable. When the duration
 * Observable emits a value or completes, the timer is disabled, then the most
 * recent source value is emitted on the output Observable, and this process
 * repeats for the next source value.

 * `auditTime` is similar to `throttleTime`, but emits the last value from the

 * timer is enabled. Initially, the timer is disabled. As soon as the first
 * source value arrives, the timer is enabled. After `duration` milliseconds (or
 * the time unit determined internally by the optional `scheduler`) has passed,
 * the timer is disabled, then the most recent source value is emitted on the
 * output Observable, and this process repeats for the next source value.
 * Optionally takes a {@link IScheduler} for managing timers.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.auditTime(1000);

 *

 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.
 * );
 *
 * @see {@link timeoutWith}
 *
 * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values
 *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete
